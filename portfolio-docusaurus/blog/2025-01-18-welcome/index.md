Welcome to my new portfolio blog! 🎉

I've recently migrated my portfolio from a custom Vite + React setup to Docusaurus, and I'm excited about the possibilities this opens up.

## Why Docusaurus?

After working with a custom portfolio setup, I decided to migrate to Docusaurus for several reasons:

1. **Built-in blog functionality** - Perfect for sharing thoughts and project updates
2. **MDX support** - I can embed React components directly in my blog posts
3. **SEO optimization** - Static site generation with excellent search engine optimization
4. **TypeScript support** - Full TypeScript integration out of the box
5. **Customization** - Still flexible enough to create custom components and layouts

## What's Next?

I'll be using this blog to share:
- Project updates and releases
- Technical insights and tutorials
- Thoughts on software engineering and computer science
- Academic journey at Northeastern University

Stay tuned for more content! 🚀
