I know that all my Java people boutta be hating on me for this, but I don't care haha - I wanted to really build something interesting and easy for ***me*** to build - mainly because I have intensions of adding some cool features to said game. :)

I think I'm inheritly attracted to this idea because I love video games, languages, and programming - so why not.
