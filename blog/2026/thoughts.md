So far, I think that the Docusaurus platform has been nice... I'm still trying to understand the
```ts
<layout>
    <main>
    <div>
      {content}
    </div>

    </main>
</layout>
```
I know that it's the structure of the whole page - but want to figure out how to edit things.

Overall, I found that these few things were something had helped me get started with Docusaurus:

> 1. The [Docusaurus Tutorial](https://docusaurus.io/docs/tutorial/create-a-page) was a great place to start
> 2. The [Docusaurus Docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/intro) were a great resource for learning more about Docusaurus
> 3. The [Docusaurus GitHub Repo](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) was a great resource for learning more about the Docusaurus codebase
